EFMP: EDSL For Managing Processes
=================================

This is for now highly exerimental.

The idea is to launching and keeping track of processes running on many hosts,
as `nohup setsid` jobs, PBS jobs, or alike from a single clear source file.

If you're curious you may try to run `omake` and look at the
`./src/test/efmp_test.ml` for an example of usage.


Any questions, use [a github issue](https://github.com/smondet/efmp/issues) or
email `seb —at— mondet.org`.
